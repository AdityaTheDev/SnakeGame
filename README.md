# SnakeGame
This is a classic game SNAKE GAME. This is the game first mobile game which was in NOKIA 3030. Developed this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have created different modules for different functionalities. I have got hands on experience of Software Development by doing this project. Basically the HTML and CSS files provided the stucture. game.js file actually creates the logic for the game. snake.js, treat.js and grid.js are modules which has different fuctionalities and it has been imported in the main game.js file. This is a simple game but teaches a lot about JavaScript programming.
